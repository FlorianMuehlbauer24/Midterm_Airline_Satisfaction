Midterm Project: Airline Customer Satisfaction

Data Analysts: Bartek and Florian

Dataset: Airline Passenger Satisfaction
Source: Kaggle, Link to Dataset
Rows: 129k
Features: 20+

The dataset comprises the results of a survey conducted by an airline to assess passenger satisfaction. 
It includes:
Passenger information: sex, type of travel, and travel class.
Ratings for satisfaction across various categories, such as onboard service, food, cleanliness, and an overall satisfaction rating (satisfied/not satisfied).
Flight details: distance and delay.

Idea:
The objective is to predict the satisfaction of business class passengers for future flights based on their characteristics. The outcome will be utilized to identify flights where a high proportion of passengers are predicted to have a low satisfaction rate. Incentives will then be offered on those flights to enhance passenger satisfaction and cultivate loyalty.
